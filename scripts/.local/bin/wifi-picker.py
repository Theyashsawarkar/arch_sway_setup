"""Themed wrapper around the system's networkmanager_dmenu (see
ARCHITECTURE.md's networkmanager-dmenu entry). Adds category-based Pango
colors -- network / saved connection / command -- on top of upstream's
existing active-connection highlight, so the different kinds of rows in
the menu ("connect to this network" vs "a saved connection" vs "a command
like Rescan/Enable/Disable") are visually distinguishable at a glance
instead of all rendering the same color. Also strips the Bluetooth toggle
out of the command list -- this menu is WiFi-only now, Bluetooth gets its
own separate picker (bluetooth-picker.py) with its own unique options.

Monkeypatches three functions (get_wofi_highlight_markup, get_selection,
create_other_actions) on the real installed module rather than forking
the whole script -- everything else (NetworkManager interaction,
connecting, scanning, password prompts) still comes from the real,
maintained upstream package. Category detection is by Action.func
identity (process_ap == a real network) plus the ":SAVED" suffix upstream
already puts on saved-connection action names -- both are core to how
the tool actually works, not incidental detail likely to silently
change, but wrapped defensively (_category() swallows any
AttributeError) so a future upstream refactor degrades to "no color"
rather than a crash.

get_selection is simplified from upstream to the wofi-only code path
(upstream branches on rofi/wofi/plain-dmenu; this repo only ever uses
wofi, dmenu_command=wofi is hardcoded in config.ini) -- kept otherwise as
close to a literal copy as possible, since the line-generation and
selection-matching have to stay in exact sync or clicking an entry either
does nothing or fires the wrong action.
